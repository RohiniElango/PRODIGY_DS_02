Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project was completed as part of the **Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech**.  
It focuses on performing **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset used is [`train.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data), which includes passenger information from the Titanic disaster.  
It contains 891 records with the following key features:

- `PassengerId`
- `Pclass` (Ticket class)
- `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`
- `SibSp`, `Parch` (Family info)
- `Ticket`, `Fare`
- `Cabin`, `Embarked`
- `Survived` (Target variable: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)

🧠 Project Objectives

- Import and inspect the data
- Handle missing values and perform data cleaning
- Analyze distributions and patterns
- Explore relationships using visualizations
- Derive insights about survival chances


🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

 📊 Key Insights

- 🎯 **Gender**: Women had a much higher survival rate than men.
- 🎯 **Class**: Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive.
- 🎯 **Age**: Children (especially under age 10) had higher chances of survival.
- 🎯 **Fare**: Passengers who paid more for tickets had a better survival rate.

 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how EDA can reveal important trends in real-world data.  
By analyzing the Titanic dataset, we gained insights into which groups were more likely to survive the disaster.
